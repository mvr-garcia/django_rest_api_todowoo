TodoWoo - Django Projet with REST API and Token Authentication
======

TodoWoo is a web application that create a ToDo List. The application has a Rest API built with Django Rest Framework - DRF.
The API allow us to manipulate all application via CUrl commands, without the need to access the graphical interface generated by the DRF.
------
The API and the JSon Web Token - JWT Login, was developed by me during the course "Creating Python APIs Like a BOSS" by ZappyCode.
The  web application already has been created by Nick from ZappyCode. So our task was to create an API for an existing application.

Course:
[Creating Python APIs Like a BOSS - The Django REST Framework](https://zappycode.com/courses/creating-apis-with-the-django-rest-framework-python)
